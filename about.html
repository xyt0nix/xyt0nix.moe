    <h1>A little about me:</h1>
    <p>Hey! My name is Cole and I've got a whole lot to say, but I'll make this quick! I'm 19, polyam, and crazy interested in computers and how they work. I've got a strong passion for learning new things, and that includes HTML, CSS, along with C++. On top of that, I also enjoy playing some MilSim/Realism survival games like Arma, DayZ, and Project Zomboid.</p>
    <p>NOTE: This website isn't finished! Sorry if it looks rough, I'm still working on learning how things work and will be updating it. Keep in touch!</p>
